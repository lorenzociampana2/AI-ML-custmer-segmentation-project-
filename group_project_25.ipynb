        "The dataset we are interested in here is called \"CIFAR10\". It is described [in this page](https://keras.io/api/datasets/cifar10/).\n",

        "You should compare several candidate neural network architectures, and make a decision about which is best for the task at hand.\n",
        "You should be explicit about the indicator(s) you base your decision on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, as a bonus, you could try to evaluate whether it is better to:\n",

        "* use a large model that was pre-trained on ImageNet ;\n",
        "* pre-train a model on another dataset called [CIFAR100](https://keras.io/api/datasets/cifar100/) and fine-tune it on CIFAR10.\n",
